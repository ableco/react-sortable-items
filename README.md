# react-sortable-items
Sort stuff with React.js

Based on [jasonslyvia/react-anything-sortable](https://github.com/jasonslyvia/react-anything-sortable) but without jQuery.

# Usage
Follow the usage for react-anything-sortable. Sorting only works vertically (for now) and any element with "is-isolated" as a class won't inadvertently trigger sorting (useful, for example, if you need a delete button on an item).

# TODO
- [ ] Horizontal sorting
- [ ] Optional classnames if you're not using [SUIT CSS](http://suitcss.github.io/)
- [ ] npm
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] Examples
